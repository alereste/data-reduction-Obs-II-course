# data-reduction-Obs-II-course
Material of the master-level course "Observational Astrophysics II" at the Department of Astronomy of Stockholm University.

Developer: Mattia Sirressi
Project leader and teacher of the course: Matthew Hayes

This project has been financed by Stockholm University - Department of Astronomy with a grant earned by Matthew Hayes.
The goal of the project is the developement of jupyter notebooks that can be used by students to go through each step of the data reduction 
of Optical spectroscopy using data taken with the Nordic Optical Telescope.
Feel free to use and share this material as a pedagogic resource. 
Potentially this material can be improved/expanded such that astronomers may use it for a "personalized" data reduction with sicentific purposes.

The motivation for putting together such a pedagogic material lies in the need

The material consists in eight notebooks and a bunch of files required for the data reduction. 
Each notebook is documented and contains the explanation of why that specific step of the data reduction is needed and how it is performed.
You will find most of the information you need to run the notebooks in the first introductory one, where the reader is assumed to have zero or little knowledge 
of jupyter notebooks. Previous basic knowledge of python is highly recommended.

In order to reduce other data the user might need to download other files linked in the notebooks...
